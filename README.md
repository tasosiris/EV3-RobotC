# EV3-RobotC
This code is the one that placed my team in the 2nd place in the greek robotics competition of 2019(hosted by WRO hellas)!
Here is the video of the final try: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxmaKZW-9_0
Most of the team in WRO competitions are using lego labview to program their robots.
Me and my team found interesting the idea of programming our robot in C.

In the uploaded code you will find:
  1) tasks in which is listed the "main task" because we had a challenge in freezing the whole robot in case a sensor malfunctioned during a test run.
  2) funtions that are used throughout the program 
  3) the main program 
  
Keep in mind that this is work of a couple of months and other teams arround the world are charging hundreds od dollars to upload the full code like that.
The reason why I upload this is that I have changed multiple of the function used in this code so these are outdated.
Plus this year is my final year in WRO competitions as I am in the last year of High School.
I hopw this code can help a team achieve what my team has achieved in the last couple of years (golden, silver medals) while having fun.

Lastly please don't just copy the functions in this code as you will need the same exact robot built that we had for this to work.
Use the algorithms in this code but se the parameters right for your robot.

Now the boring stuff:
Motor[a],[b],[c],[d] are Medium EV# motors.
S1,S2,S3 are ev3 color sensors and S4 is hitech color sensor v2.

Have Fun!
